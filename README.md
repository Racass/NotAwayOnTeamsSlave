# MySlave


This project is intended to not let teams change to away status.  
This is done by searching by all process that has "TEAMS" on its name and sending a key stroke (F13).


## How to run

Simple open .sln file and hit start.  
For now I don't created a way to start it automatically nor created a release version.
